        <div class="final-content">
            <p>Ishaani,</p>
            
            <p>
As these photos come to an end, my words finally begin, because there are things I’ve carried in my heart for a long time that pictures alone could never say. Falling in love with you wasn’t planned, but somehow it became the most natural thing, and I see so much truth in your intentions and such purity in your soul that sometimes I wonder what I did to deserve someone like you.
</p>

<p>
Somewhere between the conversations, the festivals, the late night talks, watching movies together and the quiet care you showed me, you became home to me in a way I never expected. You are the only person who has ever made me feel like this - seen, understood, and chosen, even when it wasn’t easy. You stayed when I was sick, when I was hurting, and even when I tried to push you away because I didn’t want you to be stuck in something hard, and yet you still cared in ways that felt effortless and real.
</p>

<p>
You cared for me before you even fully knew me, like you made that scarf without us ever having met, and I don’t think you realize how deeply that touched me. That kind of care doesn’t come from obligation it comes from a beautiful heart. I know I have flaws, real ones, and I know being with me hasn’t always been simple, yet you still chose to stand beside me, to comfort me, and to make me feel safe in moments when I didn’t even feel okay with myself.
</p>

<p>
I don’t think words are ever enough to express how I feel for you, but I do know this I’ve never felt this comfortable with anyone, never felt someone feel so much like home. Every time I look at you, every time I think of us, I’m reminded of how lucky I am to have you in my life, and how quietly, deeply, not a single day goes by where I don’t think about you
</p>

<p>
As you step into this new year of your life, I hope it brings you everything your heart hopes for happiness, peace, growth, and moments that make you smile without even realizing it. You deserve all the love the world has to offer, and I hope you always know how much you mean to me, today and every day after.
</p>

<p>
I love you. 💖
